## Common Git Commands

- git commit -m "commit message"  
  Commit changes with a descriptive message.

- git push  
  Push local commits to the remote repository.

- git pull  
  Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.

## Basic Git Workflow

1. Initialize or clone a repository.
2. Make changes to files.
3. Stage the changes with git add.
4. Commit the changes with git commit.
5. Push commits to the remote repository using git push.

## Helpful Tips

- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Pull latest changes before starting your work to avoid conflicts.
- Use branches to manage features or bug fixes separately.
